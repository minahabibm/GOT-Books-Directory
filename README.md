# GOT Directory | [Live](https://rebrand.ly/c56d4)

This is a Game of Thrones (GOT) Directory; a completed Coding Challenge. A Simple Directory of all Game of Thrones books, along with information About the Books (i.e. characters, POV, Author etc.)

I created this web application using React and utilizing Material UI for styling. To obtain the books information, fetched data from an API endpoint, and presented the information to the user in a clear and responsive design. Stylistic choices of using images and icons from GOT to capture the Game of thrones theme and provide the user a pleasant UX. Currently, the website is fully responsive for mobile devices and tablets with the inclusion of dark/light system mode and manual toggle switch.
